/// there we create/destroy a CGVirtualDisplay object; here we toggle an existing hardware
/// display in/out of the layout via the private SkyLight API `SLSConfigureDisplayEnabled`.
///
/// PLATFORM: Apple Silicon + macOS 13+ ONLY. On Intel the API does not perform a true
/// disconnect. Everything is gated behind `isSupported`.
///
/// KEY QUIRK: once a display is disabled it disappears from `CGGetOnlineDisplayList`
/// (and `CGGetActiveDisplayList`). To reconnect it we must find it again via
/// `SLSGetDisplayList`, which still enumerates disabled displays. Because the disconnected
/// display is also gone from DisplayManager's list, this service keeps its own snapshot
/// (`disconnected`) of what we turned off so the UI can still offer a Reconnect action.
